        <h2 className="text-h2-title font-bold mb-5">Background</h2>
        <p className="text-body-text mb-6">
          Within just a few decades, major oil companies, manufacturing groups,
          and manufacturers of automation for production have been forced to
          surrender their position as the world's leading corporations to
          companies who make their profit almost exclusively based on data.
          Today's largest companies are the so-called FAMGA Group (Facebook,
          Apple, Microsoft, Google and Amazon), all of which base their
          operations mainly or completely on data. The latter group –those that
          really do live on data almost exclusively, is often jointly called
          FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google). Another meaningful way
          of looking at the top group is to include at least Alibaba, Uber, and
          AirBnB: the FANGAUA group, as it has been named, forms the core of the
          platform and sharing economy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body-text mb-6">
          It is a characteristic for corporations living purely on data that
          they are able to collect, crush, interpret, and resell a particular
          type of user data globally and almost as a monopoly. The FANGAUA group
          is characterized by the fact that it is the largest global market
          player in certain industries without having to invest in fixed assets.
          For example, AirBnB is the world's largest accommodation provider, yet
          it does not own any hotels. Uber is the world's largest taxi service,
          yet it does not own any taxis. Alibaba is the world's largest store
          without selling any products.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body-text mb-6">
          Continuing the trend of the most recent decades, the amount of data on
          the Internet will increase exponentially in also the coming decades -
          and perhaps its value will, as well. The key driver of this
          development is the rapid increase in the number of devices connected
          to the Internet and especially the emerging Internet of Things (IoT),
          including sensor technology for built environments, automatic
          monitoring of user data, communication between devices and the
          proliferation of things like smart clothes.

        <h2 className="text-h2-title font-bold mb-5">Impacts</h2>
        <p className="text-body-text mb-6">
          At the moment, the tools for collecting, analyzing and distributing
          data are developing at such a tremendous speed that political
          regulation is usually only able to address emerging problems and
          ethical issues with a long delay. While it is very difficult for a
          fast-growing industry to create unambiguous and up-to-date
          legislation, public administration must nevertheless be able to
          sufficiently quickly create binding international conditions for data
          ownership, privacy, direct marketing and private law issues. If this
          task fails, what may form is a new kind of Wild West that will disrupt
          structures and familiar patterns of action.
        </p>
        <p className="text-body-text mb-6">
          In the long term, poorly regulated development could lead to the
          companies controlling data and online trading growing so large that
          they would become more powerful political, economic and socio-cultural
          actors than any of the nation states or major international
          organizations, with overwhelming capabilities to persuade, lobby and
          pressure others. These capabilities could mean using not only various
          forms of bribery and blackmail, but also superior intelligence
          snapshots, the best learning AIs, and all-encompassing
          cyber-weaponization.
